# Travel App- Capstone


## Get Up and Running

`cd` into your folder and run:
- ```npm install```
- ```npm run build-dev``` for the dev mode
- ```npm run build-prod``` for the production mode
- ```npm start``` to start the app
- this app runs on localhost:3000

To ease testing on this webapp, I havenâ€™t remove my .env file. My API keys are only used for this project

## Extend Options

- Pull in an image for the country from Pixabay API when the entered location brings up no results (good for obscure localities).
